# Example Sharables Deployment Configuration
# Copy this to .sharables/.sharables-deploy.yaml and customize

deployments:
  # Deploy cursor-rules to .cursor/rules (relative to project root)
  - section: cursor-rules
    target: .cursor/rules
    method: symlink  # symlink, copy, or git-worktree
    
  # Deploy global-utilities to home directory
  - section: global-utilities
    target: ~/.local/share/sharables
    method: symlink
    
  # Example: Deploy shared-configs to project config
  # - section: shared-configs
  #   target: .config/sharables
  #   method: symlink
    
  # Example: Deploy docs as read-only copy
  # - section: docs
  #   target: .sharables-docs
  #   method: copy

# Notes:
# - target paths can be relative (to project root) or absolute
# - ~ is expanded to $HOME
# - method: symlink (recommended) maintains git connection
# - method: copy creates independent copies (no git tracking)
# - symlink method: changes at target are tracked in sharables repo
# - symlink method: commit/push from .sharables directory
